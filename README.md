# Apple Ripeness Detection using CNN

This project aims to classify apple ripeness levels (unripe, ripe, overripe)
using digital image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Dataset
The dataset consists of apple images categorized into three classes:
- Unripe
- Ripe
- Overripe

Dataset source: Kaggle (link here)

## Method
- Image preprocessing (resize, normalization, augmentation)
- CNN with transfer learning
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Open notebook
   notebooks/training_model.ipynb
3. Run all cells

## Results
- Accuracy: XX%
- Confusion Matrix available in results folder
