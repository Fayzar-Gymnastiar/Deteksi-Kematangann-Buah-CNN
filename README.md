# Apple Ripeness Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
This project focuses on predicting the ripeness level of apples using
Digital Image Processing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The system classifies apple images into three categories:
Unripe, Ripe, and Overripe.
This project was developed as a final project for the
Digital Image Processing course.
## 📌 Project Objectives
- Build an automatic system to predict apple ripeness from images
- Apply image preprocessing techniques
- Implement CNN with transfer learning
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of apple images divided into three classes:
- Unripe (Unripe apples)
- Ripe (Ripe apples)
- Overripe (Overripe apples)
Each class is stored in a separate folder.
Dataset source is obtained from a public dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asadullahprl/fruits-ripeness-classification-dataset/code).
> ⚠️ Dataset is not uploaded directly to this repository due to size limitations.
## 🧠 Methodology
The methodology used in this project includes:
1. Image preprocessing (resize, normalization)
2. Image augmentation to increase data variation
3. CNN model implementation using transfer learning
4. Model training and validation
5. Model evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy
## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
## 📊 Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision and Recall
The results show that the CNN model is capable of classifying apple ripeness
with good performance.
